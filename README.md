# BUBBLE SORT

This project is the bubble sort algorithm made it in Ruby. The bubble sort use a sorting technique that is typically used for sequencing small lists. It starts by comparing the first item to the second, the second to the third and so on until it finds one item out of order. It then swaps the two items and starts over.
